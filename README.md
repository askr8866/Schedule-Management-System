# Schedule-Management-System
Basic Implementation 
For one person (P1), the system should 
• Schedule a meeting with the following inputs from the user: 
1. Date 
2. Start time and End time (or a time slot) 
3. Room ID from a fixed set: (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5) 
• Detect any time collisions if scheduling a new meeting. 
Advanced Implementation 
For multiple people (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5), the system should 
• Include other person(s) in meeting as a parameter in a comma separated form • Detect if the other people are available during the time slot 
• Detect if there is a collision when scheduling the rooms 
Interface and implementation 
• You can choose your interface and implement the solution: Command line, RestAPI, or JS. 
• You can use any relevant database: relational, NoSQL, even JSON or CSV 
• If you are going to provide RestAPIs, define your contracts, so that we can test them
 • Since this is more of a design evaluation you can provide us some interface signatures as well
